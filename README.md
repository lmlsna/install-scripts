# install-scripts

__A bunch of bash scripts to install stuff that isn't in the Ubuntu repos yet.__
  * So I don't have to go to the website and copypaste a "pipe to bash" 
  * Or clicky clicky to download their `.deb`' file (if they are kind)
  * Plus work arounds for the problem children who hate `curl` for some reason

## Notice
  * I try to make these scripts version agnostic but distribution zealotous (#UbuntuGang)

## Contributing
  * If I screwed something up, please send a PR
  * Otherwise you should just fork your own repo
  * But do whatever you want, you're an adult
